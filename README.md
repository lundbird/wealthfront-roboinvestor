# wealthfront-roboinvestor
uses web browser automation to manage investments. \n
I gave up on this project because UI automation is very time consuming to debug.\n
The end result uses Wealthfront.com which uses an automated tax-loss haresting algorithm I had tried to hardcode into UI automation.
It is still capable of taking consistent cashflows then withdrawing and depositing from checking and wealthfront, therefore maximizing the amount of your money invested at any time. \n
For future use, financial API's exist that can be programmed to automate tax loss harvesting and cashflow synchronization, however these are expensive.  \n
For now I will still be using Wealthfront manually.
